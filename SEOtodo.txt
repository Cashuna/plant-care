		Once in the URL;
		Once in the meta description;
		At least once in an image alt attribute; and
		2-3 times in page content, with variations (pluralizations, long-tail phrases, etc.).
		Distribute keywords evenly throughout your text.



- [ ] Use headers correctly (EX: only 1 H1 per page)

- [ ] Determine image alt tags
- [ ] Determine URL structure - short and sweet
- [ X] Determine link building strategy (guest blogging, influencer marketing, etc). Pay close attention to which sites have “nofollow” links and avoid those as google will stop crawling once it hits those links. These links provide no juice. Ideally, you want links from sites with a high authority and high volume. (Linking back to our page)
